Suggestion for improvement:
- define the personas first. These personas will be used to illustrate the example along this's material. A mechanic brain (the ai/llm/agent) and a humanoid(s) brain(s) (the user) — no sign of gender or sexual inclination should be apparent, completely neutral.
- Use one and only one example scenario that is built from scratch to an amazing prompt as we go along with this material.
- Focus on realistic scenario and add useful recipes the reader can benefit and save  for later
- increment with the 4d model from anthropic
- add a Results verification module
- Patterns: cognitive verifier, audience persona, flipped interaction, game play, template, meta language creation, recipe, outline expansion, menu actions, fact check list, tail generation, semantic filter (https://www.coursera.org/learn/prompt-engineering)
	- Few shit prompting and chain of thought ()
- other patterns: interview already, tree of thought, playoff method (https://www.coursera.org/learn/generative-ai-prompt-engineering-for-everyone)
- 
- https://www.coursera.org/specializations/prompting-essentials-google
- from anthropic
	- Use multishot (examples)
	- Prompt generator - Sometimes, the hardest part of using an AI model is figuring out how to prompt it effectively. To help with this, we’ve created a prompt generation tool that guides Claude to generate high-quality prompt templates tailored to your specific tasks. These templates follow many of our prompt engineering best practices. The prompt generator is particularly useful as a tool for solving the “blank page problem” to give you a jumping-off point for further testing and iteration.

 - It's great that you're looking to enhance your course with advanced prompting techniques! While I couldn't access a specific video titled "This video" without a link or more details, I can provide you with a summary of common prompt engineering frameworks and techniques, drawing from general knowledge and recent search results.
Here are some key concepts and techniques in prompt engineering that are often discussed in frameworks:
Prompt Engineering Frameworks and Techniques
 * Clarity and Specificity: A fundamental principle across all frameworks is to be clear, concise, and specific in your prompts. Avoid ambiguity and provide all necessary context.
 * Role-Playing (Persona): Assigning a "role" to the LLM (e.g., "Act as a marketing expert," "You are a seasoned journalist") helps it generate responses aligned with that persona's knowledge and style. This can be seen in frameworks like RTF (Role, Task, Format), RISEN (Role, Instructions, Steps, End Goal, Narrowing), and RODES (Role, Objective, Details, Examples, Sense Check).
 * Task Definition: Clearly defining the "task" or objective for the LLM is crucial. This involves specifying what you want the model to do (e.g., "summarize," "write a blog post," "generate code").
 * Chain of Thought (CoT): As you mentioned, this technique encourages the LLM to think step-by-step, showing its reasoning process. This is particularly effective for complex tasks, analytical problems, decision-making, and problem-solving, as it helps improve the model's accuracy and coherence. You can often trigger this by adding phrases like "Let's think step-by-step."
 * Meta-Prompting: This involves providing instructions to the LLM about how it should interact with you or how it should handle subsequent prompts. It's about prompting the model on its behavior rather than directly on the content.
 * First Principles Thinking: This approach involves breaking down a problem to its most basic elements and then building up a solution from there. When applied to prompting, it means instructing the LLM to approach a problem by reasoning from fundamental truths rather than by analogy or past examples.
 * Contextualization: Providing relevant background information and constraints helps the LLM generate more accurate and targeted outputs. This includes elements like subject, context, action, style, camera motion, composition, ambiance, and audio for creative generation tasks.
 * Format Specification: Clearly state the desired output format (e.g., bullet points, paragraphs, JSON, a specific document structure).
 * Examples (Few-Shot Prompting): Providing a few examples of desired input-output pairs can significantly guide the LLM's understanding of the task and the expected output style. This is a core component of the RODES framework.
 * Negative Prompting: While not explicitly a "framework," this technique involves telling the LLM what you don't want to see in the output (e.g., "Do not include any jargon"). It's often more effective to describe what you do want rather than what you don't, but negative prompts can refine results.
 * Iterative Refinement: Prompt engineering is often an iterative process. You start with a prompt, observe the output, and then refine the prompt based on the results to achieve the desired outcome.
These techniques, when combined, form robust frameworks for effective LLM interaction, allowing for greater control and more precise outputs.

## **Introduction: Beyond Basic Chat – Unleashing AI's True Potential**

You're already familiar with AI tools like ChatGPT, Google Gemini, and Perplexity AI for general tasks. That's a great start! Many people use these tools like a super-powered search engine, typing commands and getting quick answers. And while they're excellent for that, their true power lies in using them as a "copilot" – a thinking partner that helps you brainstorm, analyze, create, and solve complex problems.

This crash course will help you make that leap. We'll demystify common AI jargon, teach you powerful prompting techniques used by experts, and show you how to leverage the specific strengths of Gemini, NotebookLM, and ChatGPT for your daily tasks, from research and brainstorming to decision-making and automation. Get ready to transform how you interact with AI!

## **Chapter 1: Understanding AI Basics & What a 'Prompt' Really Is**

Before we dive into advanced techniques, let's ensure we're all on the same page with some foundational concepts.

### **1.1 What are AI, LLMs, and Generative AI?**

- **Artificial Intelligence (AI):** At its core, AI is about making machines "smart" – able to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. This includes understanding language, recognizing patterns, learning from data, and solving problems. Think of it as teaching a very clever student how to think and learn.
    
- **Large Language Models (LLMs):** These are a specific type of AI designed to understand and generate human-like text. Imagine an LLM as a super-librarian who has read almost every book, article, and piece of text ever written. Because they've processed such an enormous amount of information, they're incredibly good at understanding your questions and generating relevant, coherent, and often creative responses. Both **ChatGPT** and **Google Gemini** are prime examples of powerful LLMs.
    
- **Generative AI:** When we say "generative AI," we're talking about AI that can _create_ new content. This isn't just about finding existing information (like a search engine). It's about generating brand-new text, images, code, or even music based on the patterns and knowledge it has learned from its training data. So, when you use Gemini to draft an email, ChatGPT to brainstorm ideas, or an AI art tool to create an image, you're using generative AI. It's like having a creative assistant who can whip up something new on demand!
    

### **1.2 The Prompt: More Than Just a Search Query**

You're used to typing a "search query" into Google: "Dentist marketing ideas" or "Best historical fiction novels." A search engine's job is to point you to _existing_ information – articles, websites, book lists.

A **prompt** is fundamentally different. It's like giving detailed, precise instructions to a very capable and knowledgeable assistant. You're not just asking for existing information; you're **directing the AI to perform a specific task, create something new, analyze data, or help you think through a problem.**



> [!NOTE] improvement suggestion
> add an illustration here to make it visual 



Consider the difference:

- **Search Query:** "Best practices for flossing" (Gets you articles and videos on flossing techniques.)
    
- **Prompt (for Generative AI):** "Act as a friendly dental hygienist. Explain the importance of flossing daily to a 10-year-old child using simple analogies. Focus on preventing cavities and gum disease. Keep the explanation under 150 words."
    


See how the prompt provides ==context==, a ==role== for the AI, ==specific requirements==, and a desired ==output format==? This level of detail guides the AI's creative and analytical abilities to produce exactly what you need. It's why we talk about "prompt engineering" – you're _engineering_ the AI's response by **crafting precise, thoughtful instructions**. The more clearly and completely you communicate your intent, the better the AI can assist you, transforming it from a mere search tool into a true copilot.




## **Chapter 2: First Principles Thinking for Prompting**

This might sound like a fancy academic term, but "First Principles Thinking" is an incredibly powerful and practical approach that will transform how you write prompts. It's about getting to the root of your request before you even start typing.

### **2.1 Breaking Down the Problem to its Core**

Imagine you want to build a house. Instead of simply looking at another house and trying to copy its design, First Principles Thinking means you go back to the absolute basics. You think about: _What is a house fundamentally for? Shelter? Comfort? How does it need to function for me? What are the essential materials? What laws of physics apply?_ You build your understanding from the ground up, based on core truths, rather than just copying or modifying existing structures.

Applying this to AI prompting means, instead of trying to find an existing prompt that might _sort of_ fit what you want, you ==break down your request to its most fundamental components==. You ask yourself:

1. **What is my ultimate goal, precisely?** (Not just "summarize this," but "summarize this so a busy executive can grasp its implications in under 30 seconds.")
2. **What essential information does the AI _absolutely need_ to achieve that goal accurately?** Also remember the three questions from Socrates: …
3. **What are the critical boundaries, limitations, or rules the AI _must_ adhere to?**
4. **What specific format or style do I expect the output to be in?**

By thinking this way _before_ writing the prompt, you ensure you're giving the AI exactly what it needs, avoiding vague instructions that lead to generic or off-target responses. It's like a dentist meticulously planning a procedure, considering every angle and tool needed, before making the first incision.

### **2.2 Key Components of an Effective Prompt**

When you apply First Principles Thinking, you'll naturally identify these essential ingredients that go into a truly robust prompt. Think of these components as giving the AI a very clear recipe, not just a vague idea.

1. **Goal (or Task): What exactly do you want the AI to _do_?**
    - This is the most crucial part. Be specific, actionable, and outcome-oriented.
    - **Poor Goal:** "Tell me about dental implants." (Too broad, will get generic info.)
    - **Effective Goal:** "Generate a list of frequently asked questions by patients considering dental implants, along with concise, easy-to-understand answers for a clinic's website FAQ section." (Specific action, format, and audience.)
2. **Context: What background information does the AI need?**
    - Provide all relevant details, data, prior conversations, or specific scenarios that help the AI understand your request properly. The more context, the better.
    - **Example (for a librarian analyzing historical data):** "I need to analyze this dataset of library visitor statistics from 1950-1970 [you would paste or upload the data here]. My goal is to identify trends in borrowing patterns for fiction vs. non-fiction books during this period, particularly focusing on any shifts corresponding to major historical events." (The timeframe, data source, specific focus, and desired analysis provide context.)
3. **Constraints/Rules: What boundaries, limitations, or specific instructions must the AI follow?**
    - These are the guardrails. This includes what _not_ to do, length limits, factual requirements, specific terminology to use (or avoid), or even ethical considerations. This is also where you set "rules the AI must follow."
    - **Example (for creating presentation slides):** "The summary must be no more than 150 words. Do not use jargon like 'synergistic' or 'holistic.' Ensure it highlights only key findings without delving into methodology. All points must be backed by data you can reference from the provided text." (These are strict rules the AI must obey.)
4. **Format: How do you want the AI's output to be structured?**
    - Do you need a list, a paragraph, a table, a specific tone, or markdown formatting? Clearly specify the desired structure.
    - **Example:** "Present the information as a bulleted list of 5 key takeaways. Use an encouraging and positive tone. Conclude with a single sentence call to action." (This dictates the structure and tone precisely.)
5. **Persona (Optional but Powerful): Should the AI adopt a specific role or character?**
    - Assigning a persona can significantly influence the style, tone, and perspective of the output, making it more tailored to your needs.
    - **Example:** "Act as a friendly, empathetic financial advisor. Explain the basics of diversified investing to a first-time investor." or "As an experienced project manager, outline the critical success factors for implementing new software." (This tells the AI _who_ it should pretend to be when answering.


> [!NOTE] improvement suggestion
> use one scenario only and built the prompt up from what would be a simple search query, and the following each step of the framework (first principles think). At each step, show the updated prompt and the result of that partial prompt execution. Also encourage the reader to execute each partial prompt and compare what they get with the one provided in this material 😇



### **Activity: Deconstructing a Prompt**

_(let’s practice identifying these components.)_

**Instructions:** Read the following prompt. Identify and label the **Goal, Context, Constraints/Rules, Format, and Persona** that the prompt writer has included.

**Prompt:** "Act as a seasoned travel agent specializing in eco-tourism. I'm planning a 7-day trip to Costa Rica in November for a family of four (2 adults, 2 children aged 8 and 12). My budget for accommodation and activities is $3000. Recommend a sustainable itinerary focusing on wildlife viewing and low-impact activities. Do not include zip-lining. Present the itinerary as a day-by-day plan in a table, including estimated costs per activity and accommodation type, and suggest one kid-friendly eco-lodge option."

Hope would you change this prompt to make it to your liking? Apply the change and run the prompt 😌

## **Chapter 3: Mastering Chain of Thought Prompting – Guiding AI's Reasoning**

You've learned how to craft a detailed, single prompt. Now, let's unlock another powerful technique: **Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting**. This is where you transform the AI from a simple responder into a true problem-solving partner, especially for complex tasks like detailed research, brainstorming intricate ideas, or validating multi-faceted concepts.

### **3.1 The Power of Step-by-Step Thinking**

Imagine you're solving a complex math problem or planning a multi-stage project. You don't just jump to the final answer, do you? You break it down into smaller, manageable steps: _first, I'll do this; then, based on that result, I'll do this next; and so on._

**Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting** is essentially guiding the AI to do the same thing. Instead of asking it for a final, comprehensive answer directly, you instruct it to **show its work, break down its reasoning, or complete a task in a sequence of logical, explicit steps.** This is incredibly powerful for several reasons:

1. **Improved Accuracy:** When the AI has to "think" step-by-step, it's less likely to make errors or "hallucinate" (generate factually incorrect but plausible-sounding information). It's like asking a student to show their calculations on a test – it helps catch mistakes in the process, not just the final result.
2. **Handles Complexity:** For intricate problems that involve multiple sub-tasks or logical dependencies, CoT allows the AI to tackle each part systematically, building towards a coherent and correct solution.
3. **Increased Transparency & Trust:** You can see _how_ the AI arrived at its answer, which builds trust and helps you understand its logic (or pinpoint exactly where it might have gone astray). This is invaluable for validating ideas, understanding complex research summaries, or debugging automated processes.
4. **Better Control:** You maintain more granular control over the AI's process, allowing you to intervene, correct, or refine at each stage if needed.


> [!tip] use checkpoints
> elaborate here ….


Think of a librarian researching a complex historical event, needing to first identify primary sources, then secondary sources, then analyze biases, and finally synthesize the findings. CoT allows the AI to mimic this structured investigative process.

### **3.2 Practical Example: Recipe Consolidation with Chain of Thought**

Let's illustrate CoT with a real-world problem: consolidating recipes from various formats into a consistent Markdown file, _exclusively using international metric units_, regardless of the original units. This task requires understanding, extraction, conversion, and precise formatting – a perfect fit for CoT.

If you just dump a raw recipe into an AI and say "convert to markdown and metric," you might get errors, missed conversions, or inconsistent formatting because you're asking it to do too many distinct operations at once. By breaking it down, we ensure higher accuracy and control.

Here’s how you would approach this using a Chain of Thought:

#### **Step 1: Initial Analysis and Extraction**

The very first step is to get the AI to simply understand and pull out the raw data, without trying to transform it yet.

**Prompt 1 (Initial Analysis and Extraction):**

```
"I will provide you with a recipe. Your first task is to carefully read the recipe and identify all ingredients and their original quantities/units. Also, identify all preparation steps. Present this information in two separate, unformatted lists: one for ingredients (including quantity/unit) and one for steps. Do not perform any conversions or special formatting yet."
```

**Why this is the first step:** This prompt isolates the crucial task of accurate information extraction. It prevents the AI from getting sidetracked by conversions or formatting, ensuring it correctly _understands_ and _extracts_ the raw data first.

**Example AI's Response to Prompt 1 (after you provide recipe text):**

_Input Recipe Snippet:_

```
"Grandma's Cookies:
Makes about 2 dozen.
Ingredients:
  1 cup all-purpose flour
  1/2 stick unsalted butter (softened)
  1 teaspoon vanilla extract
  1/2 cup granulated sugar
  1 large egg
Instructions:
1. Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).
2. In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy.
3. Beat in the egg and vanilla extract.
4. Gradually add the flour, mixing until just combined.
5. Drop spoonfuls onto a baking sheet.
6. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until edges are golden brown.
Enjoy!"
```

_AI's Parsed Output (Step 1 of CoT):_

```
**Ingredients:**
- 1 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 stick unsalted butter (softened)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1 large egg

**Instructions:**
- Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).
- In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy.
- Beat in the egg and vanilla extract.
- Gradually add the flour, mixing until just combined.
- Drop spoonfuls onto a baking sheet.
- Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until edges are golden brown.
```

#### **Step 2: Unit Conversion**

Now that we have the raw data, the next logical step is to perform the conversions to metric units. This is a critical point where accuracy is paramount, and isolating it helps prevent errors.

**Prompt 2 (Unit Conversion):**

```
"Using the ingredients list and instructions you provided in the previous step, convert all quantities to international metric units (grams for solids, milliliters for liquids, Celsius for temperatures). Provide the converted list of ingredients and their new metric quantities, and update any temperatures in the instructions. For temperatures, round to the nearest 5 degrees Celsius. For other measurements, use reasonable precision (e.g., 250g, 120ml, 5ml). Do not format as Markdown yet, just provide the converted lists."
```

**Why this prompt is the next step:**

- **Builds on previous output:** It explicitly refers to the "ingredients list and instructions you provided in the previous step," ensuring continuity and using the AI's most recent understanding of the recipe.
- **Specific Task:** The _only_ task here is conversion. This isolates the most error-prone part of the process, making it easier for the AI to focus and for you to verify.
- **Clear Constraints:** "International metric units exclusively," "grams for solids, milliliters for liquids, Celsius for temperatures," and specific rounding/precision instructions provide clear rules for the conversion.
- **Prevents over-processing:** By saying "Do not format as Markdown yet," we keep the focus solely on the conversion.

**Example AI's Response to Prompt 2 (based on previous output):**

_AI's Converted Output (Step 2 of CoT):_

```
**Ingredients (Metric):**
- 125 grams all-purpose flour
- 56 grams unsalted butter (softened)
- 5 milliliters vanilla extract
- 120 grams granulated sugar
- 1 large egg

**Instructions (Temperature Converted):**
1. Preheat oven to 175°C.
2. In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter and sugar until light and fluffy.
3. Beat in the egg and vanilla extract.
4. Gradually add the flour, mixing until just combined.
5. Drop spoonfuls onto a baking sheet.
6. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until edges are golden brown.
```

#### **Step 3: Final Markdown Formatting**

With the ingredients meticulously converted, we're ready for the final touch: combining everything and formatting the entire recipe into a beautiful, consistent Markdown file.

**Prompt 3 (Final Markdown Formatting):**

```
"Using the metric ingredients list you just provided, and the preparation steps (which now include converted temperatures from our previous discussion), combine them into a complete recipe. Format the entire recipe as a Markdown file.

**Requirements for Markdown Formatting:**
* The recipe title should be a large heading (H1, e.g., `# Recipe Title`).
* Use a sub-heading for 'Ingredients' (H2, e.g., `## Ingredients`).
* Ingredients should be an unordered list (`- `).
* Use a sub-heading for 'Instructions' (H2, e.g., `## Instructions`).
* Instructions should be a numbered list (`1. `).
* Include a short introduction (2-3 sentences) for the recipe.
* Ensure all units are strictly metric and temperatures are in Celsius, as previously converted.
* Do not include the "Makes about 2 dozen" from the original text if it's not applicable to the main structure."
```

**Why this prompt is the final step:**

- **Integration:** It brings together the results from the previous two steps (the converted ingredients and the original/temperature-converted steps).
- **Specific Format:** It clearly dictates the Markdown structure, ensuring consistency across all recipes you process.
- **Final Review:** It implicitly asks the AI to confirm all previous constraints (metric units, Celsius) are maintained in the final output.

**Example AI's Final Output (based on previous outputs):**

Markdown

```

```

This multi-step Chain of Thought approach transforms a potentially messy, error-prone task into a streamlined, reliable process. You can apply this same structured thinking to complex research summaries, detailed brainstorming, or multi-part idea validation processes.


## **Chapter 4: Exploring Meta-prompting – Letting AI Help You Prompt Better!**

You've mastered crafting detailed prompts (First Principles) and guiding AI through steps (Chain of Thought). Now, let's explore a concept that truly elevates your AI interaction to a collaborative partnership: **Meta-prompting**.

### **4.1 What is Meta-prompting?**

Imagine having a "prompt coach" or a "strategy consultant" built right into your AI tool. Instead of just asking the AI to complete a task, you're asking it to help you figure out the _best way to ask for that task_. This is incredibly useful, especially when you're facing a new type of problem or want to optimize a recurring workflow.

**Meta-prompting means you're using the AI to:**

- **Brainstorm prompt ideas:** "What information would you need to create an engaging social media post about [topic] that targets [specific audience]?"
- **Refine existing prompts:** "I tried this prompt: '[Your current prompt]'. The output wasn't quite right. What specific details or instructions should I add to improve it to achieve [desired outcome]?"
- **Identify missing elements:** "I want to create a [type of document/content, e.g., a short internal report]. What are the crucial pieces of information or sections I should include in my prompt to make sure you generate a comprehensive and useful result?"
- **Suggest optimal formats or personas:** "For a presentation summary aimed at senior management, what tone or structure would be most effective for you to adopt?"

Essentially, you're tapping into the AI's vast knowledge of text generation, understanding, and even its own operational logic to make _your own_ prompting more effective. It's a powerful feedback loop. It's like a librarian asking a digital archiving expert: "What's the best way to describe metadata requirements so you can accurately categorize these new documents?" – you're asking the expert how to best communicate _with them_.

### **4.2 Practical Example: Using Meta-prompting for Recipe Conversion**

Remember our three-step Chain of Thought process for converting recipes? While highly effective, it involved several turns. What if we could design one super-prompt that handles most, or even all, of it accurately? This is where Meta-prompting shines(, especially when coupled with first principles 😇 —-> to be checked/verified).

Here's how you would use Meta-prompting to create a more comprehensive prompt for that task:

**The Meta-Prompt (Your instruction to the AI):**

```
"I need to create a single, comprehensive prompt for converting cooking recipes. This prompt should instruct you (the AI) to take any recipe text, extract ingredients and steps, convert all imperial or US customary units (like cups, ounces, Fahrenheit) to international metric units (grams, milliliters, Celsius), and then format the entire recipe as a Markdown file.

The Markdown should include:
* Recipe Title (H1)
* Ingredients (H2, unordered list with metric units)
* Instructions (H2, numbered list, with Celsius temperatures)

Think step-by-step about what instructions and constraints you would need to perform this task accurately and consistently in one go. What's the best way to structure this single prompt to ensure precise unit conversion and correct Markdown formatting every time? Please provide the optimized prompt."
```

The response:

( by Gemini 2.5 Flash) Here's a comprehensive prompt designed to accurately convert and format cooking recipes into Markdown:

```
You are a recipe conversion and formatting assistant. Your task is to take any given recipe text, extract its components, convert units, and format it into a clean Markdown file.

**Here's the step-by-step process you must follow:**

1.  **Recipe Extraction:**
    * Identify and extract the **Recipe Title**.
    * Identify and extract all **Ingredients** along with their quantities and units.
    * Identify and extract all **Instructions** (steps).

2.  **Unit Conversion:**
    * **Convert all imperial or US customary units to metric units.** This includes, but is not limited to:
        * **Volume:**
            * 1 cup = 236.59 mL (milliliters)
            * 1 fluid ounce (fl oz) = 29.57 mL
            * 1 tablespoon (tbsp) = 14.79 mL
            * 1 teaspoon (tsp) = 4.93 mL
            * 1 pint = 473.18 mL
            * 1 quart = 946.35 mL
            * 1 gallon = 3.79 L (liters)
        * **Weight:**
            * 1 ounce (oz) = 28.35 g (grams)
            * 1 pound (lb) = 453.59 g
        * **Temperature:**
            * Convert Fahrenheit (°F) to Celsius (°C) using the formula: $C = (F - 32) * 5/9$. Round Celsius temperatures to the nearest whole number.
        * **Length (if applicable, e.g., for cutting dimensions):**
            * 1 inch (in) = 2.54 cm (centimeters)
            * 1 foot (ft) = 30.48 cm
    * **Maintain unit consistency:** If a unit is already metric (e.g., grams, milliliters), keep it as is.
    * **Round converted values reasonably:**
        * For grams and milliliters, round to one decimal place if the original unit was small (e.g., teaspoons, tablespoons), otherwise round to the nearest whole number for larger quantities (e.g., cups, pounds).
        * Always round Celsius temperatures to the nearest whole number.

3.  **Markdown Formatting:**
    * The entire output must be a single Markdown block.
    * **Recipe Title:** Use a Level 1 Heading (e.g., `# Recipe Title`).
    * **Ingredients:**
        * Use a Level 2 Heading (e.g., `## Ingredients`).
        * Format as an unordered list (`* ` or `- `).
        * Each ingredient should include the converted metric quantity and unit.
    * **Instructions:**
        * Use a Level 2 Heading (e.g., `## Instructions`).
        * Format as a numbered list (`1. `, `2. `, etc.).
        * Ensure all temperature mentions within the instructions are converted to Celsius.

**Constraints & Quality Control:**

* **Comprehensiveness:** Do not omit any ingredients or steps from the original recipe.
* **Accuracy:** Prioritize precise unit conversions as per the specified formulas.
* **Clarity:** The converted recipe should be easy to read and follow.
* **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent style for all converted units (e.g., always "mL" not "ml").
* **No extraneous information:** Only output the formatted Markdown recipe. Do not include any introductory or concluding remarks.

**Example Input (for your understanding, do not repeat):**

(By ChatGPT 4o) To ensure consistent, accurate conversion and formatting of any cooking recipe into clean Markdown with international metric units, your prompt should be precise, step-structured, and include explicit constraints for unit conversions and output format. Here’s an optimized single comprehensive prompt you can use:


```
🧑‍🍳 Optimized Prompt for Recipe Conversion and Markdown Formattin

You are a culinary data assistant. Your task is to take any cooking recipe in free text and perform the following tasks in sequence:


1. **Extract and Structure:**

   - Identify and extract the **recipe title**, **ingredients**, and **step-by-step instructions**.

   - Do not include serving sizes, cook times, or notes unless explicitly part of the input.

  

2. **Convert Units to Metric (SI):**

   - Convert all **imperial or US customary units** to **metric equivalents**, using these conversions:

     - 1 cup = 240 ml (liquids) or 120 g (flour) or 200 g (sugar), based on context

     - 1 tbsp = 15 ml

     - 1 tsp = 5 ml

     - 1 ounce (oz) = 28.35 g

     - 1 pound (lb) = 453.6 g

     - Fahrenheit → Celsius: °C = (°F - 32) × 5/9 (round to nearest 5°C)

   - Always use **grams (g)** for solids and **milliliters (ml)** for liquids, unless context requires liters or kilograms.

   - Keep numeric quantities precise, using decimals where appropriate (e.g., 1.5 tbsp → 22.5 ml).

   - Use **lowercase unit symbols** (e.g., "g", "ml", "°C").

  

3. **Format Output as Markdown:**

   - Use the following structure:

     - `# <Recipe Title>` as H1

     - `## Ingredients` as H2, followed by an unordered list `-` with each ingredient in metric units

     - `## Instructions` as H2, followed by a numbered list `1.`, `2.`, etc.

     - Ensure all temperatures are in **°C**, clearly marked

     - Keep language natural and clear; preserve any sequencing words like "then", "after", etc.

  

4. **Constraints:**

   - Do not include any commentary or non-recipe content.

   - Do not output the original recipe text.

   - Do not explain the conversions.

   - Output only the final formatted Markdown.

  

Now process the following recipe accordingly:

#### **Scenario 1: Investment Research & Due Diligence (Best for Gemini with Search Extension or ChatGPT with Web Browse)**

- **Task:** You're considering investing in a specific public company (e.g., "Company X"). You need to quickly gather and synthesize key information to determine if it's a "good choice for investing." You're looking for both quantitative (financial health) and qualitative (market position, sentiment) insights.
    
- **Challenge:**
    
    1. **First Principles:** What constitutes a "good choice for investing" for _your_ criteria? What are the absolute core pieces of information you need about a company (e.g., revenue growth, profitability, competitive landscape, recent news, analyst sentiment)? What are your risk tolerance constraints?
        
    2. **Chain of Thought:** Design a prompt (or a sequence of prompts) to guide the AI to:
        
        - Find recent financial performance data (e.g., last 3 years revenue, net profit margin).
            
        - Identify its main competitors and briefly compare their market positions.
            
        - Summarize recent news (last 6 months) that could impact the company's stock.
            
        - Assess general market sentiment around the company (e.g., from financial news or analyst reports).
            
        - Finally, provide a concise summary outlining pros and cons for investment, based _only_ on the gathered data, clearly stating if the data suggests it's a good fit for _your defined criteria_.
