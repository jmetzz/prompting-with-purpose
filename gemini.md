This project is a crash course on AI prompting for non-technical students. The goal is to teach them how to use AI as a copilot for their work. The course is divided into several chapters, each covering a different aspect of AI prompting. The target audience is students who are new to AI and have no technical background. The tone of the course should be simple, clear, and encouraging. The course should be practical and provide students with real-world examples and exercises. The course should also cover the ethical implications of using AI and how to use it responsibly.

The emphasis is firmly on prompting techniques, with search functionality presented as a complementary tool that enhances the prompting process (e.g., for gathering context or verifying output), rather than a standalone focus. More specifically on these three techniques:

1. First Principles Thinking applied to AI prompting engineering
2. Chain of Thought
3. Meta-prompting
