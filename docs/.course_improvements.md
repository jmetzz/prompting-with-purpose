# Course Improvements

- Decide on the course title!

## General Suggestions

- **Visuals:** Incorporate more visuals, such as diagrams and illustrations, to explain complex concepts.
- **Add a Visual:** Include a diagram that visually represents the difference between a search query and a prompt.

## Chapter-by-Chapter Suggestions

### General Observations

- Strengths: The course is well-structured, and the "Alex and Cortex" narrative is a great way to make the content relatable. The gardening theme is consistent and
  provides a good, non-technical throughline. The core concepts of First Principles, Chain of Thought, and Meta-Prompting are introduced well.
- Opportunities:
  - Clarity and Simplicity: Some of the language can be made even simpler and more direct. We can remove some of the more "meta" commentary about the course
    itself and just let the content flow.
  - Flow: The transitions between chapters could be smoother. We can add more explicit connections to what was learned previously and what is coming next.
  - Action-Oriented Language: We can make the language more active and encouraging, inviting the user to try things out.

#### Idea A: The "Community Garden Workshop" Scenario

- **Concept:** Alex is a community organizer tasked with creating and promoting a free workshop for locals on "How to Start Your First Urban Garden."
- **How it works across chapters:**
  - **Ch 1 (Basics):** Alex starts with a simple prompt: `Brainstorm some topics for a beginner's gardening workshop.`
  - **Ch 2 (First Principles):** Alex builds a detailed prompt to create the full workshop agenda, defining the `persona` (expert botanist), `goal` (create a 90-minute agenda), `context` (for city-dwellers with balconies), `constraints` (use simple, non-technical language), and `format` (a timed schedule).
  - **Ch 3 (CoT):** Alex uses Chain of Thought to create the actual content for one section of the workshop, like "Choosing the Right Soil." Step 1: Summarize key facts about soil types. Step 2: Draft a simple explanation. Step 3: Create a list of recommended soil brands.
  - **Ch 4 (Meta-Prompting):** Alex asks Cortex to help create a master prompt for generating engaging social media posts to promote the workshop.
  - **Ch 5 (Tools):** Alex uses Gemini to find local gardening clubs to partner with, or NotebookLM to upload and "chat with" several articles about urban gardening to answer specific questions.

#### Idea B: The "Small Online Store" Scenario

- **Concept:** Alex has just launched a small online store selling a specific craft product, like handmade candles or pottery.
- **How it works across chapters:**
  - **Ch 1 (Basics):** Alex asks: `Write a short, friendly product description for a 'Lavender & Honey' scented candle.`
  - **Ch 2 (First Principles):** Alex creates a detailed prompt to generate a "Frequently Asked Questions" page for the website, defining the `persona` (a helpful shop owner), `context` (shipping, materials, safety), and `format` (Q&A).
  - **Ch 3 (CoT):** Alex uses CoT to handle a customer inquiry. Step 1: Analyze the customer's email. Step 2: Draft a polite and helpful response. Step 3: Offer a discount on a future purchase.
  - **Ch 4 (Meta-Prompting):** Alex asks Cortex to help design the perfect prompt for writing compelling Instagram posts that drive sales.
  - **Ch 5 (Tools):** Alex uses Gemini to research competitor pricing, or ChatGPT with data analysis to analyze a CSV of sales data to find the most popular products.

#### Idea C: The "Personal Finance Blog" Scenario

- **Concept:** Alex is starting a personal blog to help other young professionals understand personal finance. This scenario has the benefit of being purely content-focused.
- **How it works across chapters:**
  - **Ch 1 (Basics):** Alex starts with: `Give me 5 blog post ideas about saving money in your 20s.`
  - **Ch 2 (First Principles):** Alex writes a detailed prompt to outline a specific blog post, defining the `persona` (a friendly, down-to-earth financial advisor), `goal` (explain compound interest simply), `constraints` (under 800 words, avoid jargon), and `format` (intro, 3 main points, conclusion).
  - **Ch 3 (CoT):** Alex uses CoT to research and write the post. Step 1: Summarize three reliable articles on compound interest. Step 2: Synthesize the findings into a single explanation. Step 3: Write the full blog post based on the synthesis.
  - **Ch 4 (Meta-Prompting):** Alex asks Cortex to help create a prompt that can generate a whole series of related blog posts.
  - **Ch 5 (Tools):** Alex uses Gemini to find recent news about market trends, or NotebookLM to upload and analyze a few financial reports.
