**Your AI Copilot Journey Continues**

You've reached the end of this crash course—but it's really just the beginning of your journey with AI.

Along the way, you've learned to:

- Break problems down using **First Principles Thinking**
- Guide AI step-by-step with **Chain of Thought Prompting**
- Refine your workflow through **Meta-Prompting**
- Choose the right AI tool for the job with **Strategic Tool Selection**

These techniques aren't just academic—they're practical tools to help you think clearer, work faster, and collaborate better with AI.

From here, the next step is practice. Use what you've learned. Try the activities again with a new angle. Apply the techniques to real tasks in your studies or work. Every prompt you write is an opportunity to get better.

Don't forget to check the [Prompt Library](prompt_library.md) for ready-to-use examples, and explore the [Advanced Topics](appendix.md) when you're ready to go deeper.

AI is your copilot—where you go next is up to you.

    It seems only [FAIR](ethical_use_of_ai.md#the-fair-framework) to let you in on a little secret.

    This entire crash course—from the explanations and examples to Alex's gardening adventures—was created by an AI, guided by a human copilot. We hope it serves as a practical demonstration of what's possible when you team up with an AI.

    The ultimate meta-prompt, if you will.

    Now go build something amazing. Your copilot is ready.
