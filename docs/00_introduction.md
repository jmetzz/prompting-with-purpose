## Introduction: From Simple Questions to Powerful Solutions

You've probably used AI to ask a question or find a quick fact. But what if you could use it to invent a new recipe, plan a complex project, or get a second opinion on a big decision?

This crash course is designed to take you from a casual user to a confident AI user. We'll show you how to move beyond simple questions and start using AI as a true partnerâ€”a "copilot" that can help you brainstorm, create, and solve problems.

### What to Expect

We'll cut through the jargon and show you the three key techniques that will transform how you use AI:

1. **First Principles Thinking:** Learn to ask for what you _really_ want.
2. **Chain of Thought Prompting:** Guide the AI step-by-step to get better, more accurate results.
3. **Meta-Prompting:** Get the AI to help you write better prompts.

We'll use real-world examples and introduce you to Alex, a creative professional who is learning right alongside you. By the end of this course, you'll have a powerful new skillset to help you in your daily work, studies, and even your personal life.

Let's begin!
