**Tired of asking AI simple questions? Ready to solve real problems instead?**

Youâ€™ve probably used AI to get a quick fact or answer. But what if you could use it to plan a trip, improve your writing, map out a complex projectâ€”or spot blind spots and missed assumptions before they trip you up?

This crash course teaches you to use AI as a **thinking partner**â€”not just a search engine. Whether youâ€™re planning a project, tackling a tough decision, or trying to be more creative, youâ€™ll learn how to write prompts that make AI genuinely useful.

## What to Expect

We'll cut through the jargon and focus on three essential techniques:

1. **First Principles Thinking:** Ask for what you _really_ want
2. **Chain of Thought Prompting:** Break down complex tasks step by step
3. **Meta-Prompting:** Let the AI help you prompt better

## Meet Your Guides

Youâ€™ll follow two characters throughout the courseâ€”each one representing a side of the human-AI partnership.

!!! quote "Alex"
    Iâ€™m Alexâ€”a curious learner like you. I ask questions, try new prompts, and figure things out step by step. I donâ€™t always get it right the first time, but thatâ€™s part of learning.

!!! quote "Cortex"
    Iâ€™m Cortexâ€”the AI in this partnership. I think fast, stay focused, and follow your lead. Iâ€™m here to help you solve problems, generate ideas, and see things from new angles.

We'll use examples featuring Alex and Cortex to guide you. By the end of this course, you'll have a new skillset to help you in your daily work, studies, and even your personal life.
