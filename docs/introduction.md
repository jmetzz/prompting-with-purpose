You probably already know how to ask AI for facts. But what if you used it to think more clearly, creatively, and critically?

This course teaches you to use AI as a thinking partnerâ€”a tool for planning, problem-solving, and uncovering blind spots. In this introduction, youâ€™ll see whatâ€™s ahead: a hands-on, jargon-free journey designed for curious minds, not just tech experts.

## Meet Your Guides

Youâ€™ll follow two characters throughout the courseâ€”each one representing a side of the human-AI partnership.

!!! quote "Alex"
    Iâ€™m Alexâ€”a curious learner like you. I ask questions, try new prompts, and figure things out step by step. I donâ€™t always get it right the first time, but thatâ€™s part of learning.

!!! quote "Cortex"
    Iâ€™m Cortexâ€”the AI in this partnership. I think fast, stay focused, and follow your lead. Iâ€™m here to help you solve problems, generate ideas, and see things from new angles.

---

Youâ€™ll see them in examples throughout the course, working together to solve problems, learn faster, and think better.

## How the Course Works

The course is organized into short chapters, each introducing a key technique or concept. Youâ€™ll learn by doingâ€”through examples, activities, and ready-to-use prompts. Youâ€™ll take away a toolkit for working smarter with AI.

## Who This Course Is For (And Who It Is Not For)

This course is designed for adult learnersâ€”professionals, students, and curious mindsâ€”who want to develop practical, real-world skills for using AI. It is specifically tailored for a non-technical audience.

!!! attention "Attention"
    It is **not** intended to replace formal education or to be used as a teaching tool for children. The focus is on critical and responsible use of AI by adults in professional and personal contexts. I believe that while AI is a powerful tool, its application in educational settings, especially for younger learners, requires a level of caution and pedagogical consideration that is outside the scope of this course.
