**Ready go beyond asking questions and start solving real problems with AI?**

You've probably used AI to ask a question or find a quick fact. But what if you could use it to invent a new recipe, plan a complex project, or get a second opinion on a big decision?

This crash course is designed to take you from a casual user to a confident AI user. We'll show you how to move beyond simple questions and start using AI as a true partner—a "copilot" that can help you brainstorm, create, and solve problems.

## What to Expect

We'll cut through the jargon and show you the three key techniques that will transform how you use AI:

1. **First Principles Thinking:** Learn to ask for what you _really_ want.
2. **Chain of Thought Prompting:** Guide the AI step-by-step to get better, more accurate results.
3. **Meta-Prompting:** Get the AI to help you write better prompts.

## Meet Your Guides

To make this journey more engaging, we've created two characters to guide you through the material. They represent the two sides of the human-AI partnership: the curious user and the powerful tool.

### Meet Alex: Your Human Guide

Alex is a creative and curious professional, learning how to use AI right alongside you. Think of Alex as your stand-in—they ask the questions you might be thinking, try out new prompts, and figure things out step-by-step.

We’ve intentionally designed Alex to be gender-neutral, so that **anyone can see themselves in Alex’s shoes**. The best way to picture Alex is not by their appearance, but by their actions: leaning forward with a new idea, sketching in a notebook, or having that "aha!" moment. They are a silhouette of focused curiosity, representing the human drive to learn, create, and solve problems.

### Meet Cortex: Your AI Copilot

Cortex is your friendly, non-human guide. It's the voice of the AI itself. Imagine a shimmering, floating brain made of pure information, equipped with a headset to communicate its vast knowledge. Cortex is logical, endlessly patient, and capable of generating incredible things in an instant.

It doesn't have feelings, but it has a clear purpose: to understand your instructions and provide the best possible response. It's the engine of creativity and analysis that you'll be learning to direct.

We'll use examples featuring Alex and Cortex to guide you. By the end of this course, you'll have a new skillset to help you in your daily work, studies, and even your personal life.
